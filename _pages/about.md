As a PhD student with a background in particle physics, I have developed a deep passion for applying my skills and knowledge to the field of medical imaging. With a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning, I am committed to using cutting-edge technology to advance the understanding and treatment of complex medical conditions.
My current research focuses on incorporating physical domain knowledge into artificial intelligence methods to improve medical imaging and produce high-resolution images that can help diagnose and treat a wide range of diseases. 
My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of medical imaging technology, working collaboratively with clinicians and other researchers to make a real difference in patients' lives.
